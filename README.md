## Engineering Philosophy
I view software engineering as a discipline of trade-offs and structural integrity. My approach is defined by:
*   **Modularity over Monoliths:** Building systems that are easy to test, debug, and extend.
*   **Pragmatism:** Choosing the right tool for the problem rather than following trends.
*   **Production-First Thinking:** Writing code that accounts for **logging, error handling**, and edge cases from day one.
*   **Bridging the Gap:** Ensuring that ML models are not just accurate notebooks, but **deployable software components**.
