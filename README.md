# Rohit Pawar

**AI Backend Engineer | Systems Architect | Python Developer**

---
## Executive Summary
Backend Engineer specializing in the intersection of **scalable API architecture** and **machine learning integration**. I focus on bridging the gap between data science prototypes and **production-grade software systems**. My core competency lies in designing robust backend services (**FastAPI, Flask**) that can reliably execute ML models, handle complex data pipelines, and maintain performance under load. I am committed to writing **clean, modular code** that prioritizes system longevity, maintainability, and real-world applicability.
